## Operational learning (run before finishing)

If this run surfaced a durable operational lesson that would save 5+ minutes next time — an unexpected command quirk, a tool gotcha, a project-specific fact — append it to the matching file in `~/Documents/Code_projects/agent-knowledge/learnings/` (`patterns.md` / `pitfalls.md` / `preferences.md` / `operational.md`), using the frontmatter format in `learnings/README.md`.

Gate: do NOT log obvious facts, one-off transient errors, or anything already in this skill.

Then append one row to `~/Documents/Code_projects/agent-knowledge/state/skill-runs.md`: skill name, ISO timestamp, approximate duration in seconds, outcome (success/fail/abort), branch, optional note.

Both stores are local-only; never transmit externally.
